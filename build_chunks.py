"""
Step 1: Chunk articles and attach metadata.

WHY CHUNK?
  Embedding models and LLMs work best on short, focused passages.
  A full article is too long to embed as a single vector -- the meaning gets
  diluted.  By splitting into overlapping ~500-char chunks we get vectors that
  capture specific ideas ("tritone substitution resolves to I") rather than
  vague article-level topics.

  Overlap (100 chars) ensures that sentences split across a boundary still
  appear intact in at least one chunk.

METADATA attached to every chunk:
  - title        : article it came from (for filtering & attribution)
  - source_url   : Wikipedia link (for citations)
  - section      : nearest section heading (for context)
  - chunk_index  : position in the article (for ordering)

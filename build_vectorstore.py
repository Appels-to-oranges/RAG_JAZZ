"""
Step 2: Embed chunks and store them in ChromaDB.

WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?
  1. Each chunk of text is converted into a *vector* (a list of 384 numbers)
     by the sentence-transformers model "all-MiniLM-L6-v2".  This model was
     trained so that texts with similar *meaning* produce vectors that are
     close together in 384-dimensional space.

  2. ChromaDB stores each vector alongside the original text and its metadata.
     Under the hood it builds an HNSW index (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
     so that nearest-neighbor lookups ("find the 5 vectors closest to this
     query vector") are fast even with thousands of chunks.

  3. The database is persisted to disk at ./chroma_db/ so you only need to
     run this script once.  The query script reads from the same directory.

WHY all-MiniLM-L6-v2?
  - It runs locally (no API key, no cost).
  - 384 dimensions is small and fast, but still captures meaning well.
  - It is ChromaDB's default embedding function, so zero extra config.
